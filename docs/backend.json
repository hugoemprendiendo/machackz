    "reasoning": "Given the simplicity of the 'HelloDisplay' app, which only needs to display a static greeting, the Firestore structure is straightforward. A single collection, 'greetings', is used to store the greeting data.  This collection will contain a single document. No user-specific data or authorization is needed, so no user collections or complex access control is required. This design prioritizes simplicity and efficiency, which are key given the limited scope of the app. The app shows a static text, so the read access can be open to everyone, removing the necessity to check roles or owners. Therefore, authorization independence does not play a role. QAPs are not relevant, due to the lack of list operations and the limited data set."
